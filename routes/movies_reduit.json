The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about \"the enemy\" and the \"rights and wrongs\" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality.","genres":["Drama","War"],"imdb":{"rating":8.1,"votes":44514,"id":20629},"languages":["English","French","German","Latin"],"lastupdated":"2015-08-15 00:10:14.427000000","metacritic":null,"num_mflix_comments":2,"plot":"A young soldier faces profound disillusionment in the soul-destroying horror of World War I.","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg2MWQ4MDEtOGZlNi00MTg0LWIwMjQtYWY5NTQwYmUzMWNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg2MzE2OTE@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","rated":"UNRATED","released":"1930-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","runtime":136,"title":"All Quiet on the Western Front","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":3.9,"numReviews":17424,"meter":89},"dvd":{"$date":"1999-01-05T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":8.9,"numReviews":40,"meter":98},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-23T18:40:18Z"},"consensus":"Director Lewis Milestone's brilliant anti-war polemic, headlined by an unforgettable performance from Lew Ayres, lays bare the tragic foolishness at the heart of war.","rotten":1,"production":"Universal Pictures","fresh":39},"type":"movie","writers":["Erich Maria Remarque (by)","Maxwell Anderson (adaptation)","George Abbott (screen play)","Del Andrews (adaptation)","C.

Hutter's trek is an unusual one, with many locals not wanting to take him near the castle where strange events have been occurring. Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count the house, but he also notices and feels unusual occurrences, primarily feeling like there is a dark shadow hanging over him, even in the daytime when the Count is unusually asleep. Hutter eventually sees the Count's sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a book he has recently read, believes the Count is really a vampire or Nosferatu. While Hutter is trapped in the castle, the Count, hiding in a shipment of coffins, makes his way to Wisbourg, causing death along his way, which most attribute to the plague. Hutter himself tries to rush home to save his town and most importantly save Ellen from Nosferatu's imminent arrival. In Wisbourg, Ellen can feel the impending darkness as Nosferatu gets closer.

As Tony is thinking bigger than Johnny and is not afraid of anyone or anything, Tony increasingly makes decisions on his own instead of following Johnny's orders, especially in not treading on the north side run by an Irish gang led by a man named O'Hara, of whom Johnny is afraid. Tony's murder spree increases, he taking out anyone who stands in his and Johnny's way of absolute control on the south side, and in Tony's view absolute control of the entire city. Tony's actions place an unspoken strain between Tony and Johnny to the point of the two knowing that they can't exist in their idealized world with the other. Tony's ultimate downfall may be one of two women in his life: Poppy, Johnny's girlfriend to who Tony is attracted; and Tony's eighteen year old sister, Cesca, who is self-professed to be older mentally than her years much to Tony's chagrin, he who will do anything to protect her innocence. Cesca ultimately comes to the realization that she is a lot more similar to her brother than she first imagined.","genres":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"imdb":{"rating":7.8,"votes":18334,"id":23427},"languages":["English"],"lastupdated":"2015-09-03 00:32:16.227000000","metacritic":null,"num_mflix_comments":1,"plot":"An ambitious and near insanely violent gangster climbs the ladder of success in the mob, but his weaknesses prove to be his downfall.","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmMxZTU2ZDUtM2Y1MS00ZWFmLWJlN2UtNzI0OTJiOTYzMTk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUxODE0MDY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","rated":"PASSED","released":"1932-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","runtime":93,"title":"Scarface","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":3.9,"numReviews":25579,"meter":86},"dvd":{"$date":"2007-05-22T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":8.7,"numReviews":34,"meter":100},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-14T19:30:50Z"},"rotten":0,"production":"Universal Pictures","fresh":34},"type":"movie","writers":["Armitage Trail (novel)","Ben Hecht (screen story)","Seton I.

When another tribe member returns from trading furs with the white men for items such as a gun and an iron needle, Mala's wife, Aba, urges him to make the 500-mile trek across the frozen tundra to do the same. After the long night of winter, Mala does go with his family to the white man's \"floating house\" in Tjarnak. The friendly captain makes trade for Mala's excellent furs, but upsets Mala when he insists that Aba sleep with him that night. \"He didn't even ask me!\" Mala complains. Afterwards, the captain suggests that Mala go whale hunting and promises not to touch his wife, so Mala agrees. But news of a successful catch spurs a celebration on board ship, and the captain has Aba forcibly removed from her tent, plied with liquor, and then he rapes her. In the morning, the still-drunk Aba staggers from the ship, but collapses in the snow, where she is mistaken for an animal by a hunter and shot and killed. When Mala returns from the whaling expedition, he learns that Aba \"has swallowed sleep.\" He is so enraged he harpoons the captain, packs up his dog sled team and leaves with the rest of his family. It takes some time to recover from his grief and take on two new wives including Iva, who has loved him all along. The newly formed Royal Canadian Mounted Police learns of the murder and dispatches two mounties to arrest Mala. Ironically, Mala finds them frozen in the snow, near death, and saves their lives reluctantly, since he now trusts no white man. But they convince him they are his friends and must go back with them or else they may starve. So he goes, leaving his family behind. At the RCMP base, Mala learns from a translator he may hang. With great effort, he slips out of his shackled wrist, injuring his hand, steals food and a dog sled team and heads back to his land.
